# The World of Numbers

Given two integers, X and Y, find their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

## Input Format

Two lines containing one integer each (X and Y, respectively).

## Constraints

-100 <= X, Y <= 100
Y != 0

## Output Format

Four lines containing the sum (X + Y), difference (X – Y), product (X x Y), and quotient (X / Y), respectively.
(While computing the quotient, print only the integer part.)

## Sample Input

```abc
5
2
```

## Sample Output

```abc
7
3
10
2
```

## Explanation

```math
5 + 2 = 7
5 - 2 = 3
5 * 2 = 10
5 / 2 = 2 (Integer part)
```
